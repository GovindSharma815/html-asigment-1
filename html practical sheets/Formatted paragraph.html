        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages with HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.
        <br>HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as <b>headings, paragraphs,list,links,quotes and other items</b>
        <br>HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using <u>angle brackets</u>.Tags such as &lt;img/&gt; and &lt;input/&gt; directly introduce content into the page.
        <br>Other tags such as &lt;p&gt; surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags such as sub-elements.
        <br>Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
