4.what are html entities with example ?
A4.	Many symbols and special characters are required while developing a web page in html, but as we know that sometimes the use of characters 
	directly may interfere with the actual html code which have certain characters reserved and also certain characters being not available on keyboard. 
	Thus, to avoid the conflict and at same time to be able to use different symbols in our code w3 org provides us with 'Character Entities'.
	Some character may be reserved for HTML and cannot be used directly as it may obstruct the actual HTML codes. For example, trying to display 
	the left and right angle brackets (<>) in the source code may cause unexpected results in the output. 
	Similarly, white spaces as written in the source code may not display as expected in the output HTML.
	
Character	Description	Entity Name	Entity Number
“ ”		non-breaking 	&nbsp;	&#160;
“<”		less than	&lt;	&#60;
“>”		greater than	&gt;	&#62;
“&”		ampersand	&amp;	&#38;
“—”		em dash	&mdash;	&#8212;
“–”		en dash	&ndash;	&#8211;
“©”		copyright	&copy;	&#169;
“®”		registered trademark	&reg;	&#174;

		</head>
 
	<body>
    <h2>GeeksforGeeks</h2>
    <h4>HTML Unordered List</h4>

	<head>
    	<title>HTML Lists</title>
	</head>

        <li>C++</li>
        <li>Core-Java</li>
